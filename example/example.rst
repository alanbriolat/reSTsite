An example reStructuredText file
================================

.. metadata::
    layout: default.html

This is an example reStructuredText file.  It is processed with Docutils_ before
being fed into the template engine.  Metadata can be defined in the ``metadata``
directive as YAML.

Also available is the ``code`` directive, using Pygments_ to provide syntax
highlighting, like so:

.. code:: python

    def foo()
        print "Hello, world!"

.. _Pygments: http://pygments.org/
